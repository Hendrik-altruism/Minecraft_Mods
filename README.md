# Some Factions MC-Plugin

This Plugin provides 4 factions in total, which all have unique traits and features.
You can choose your faction with the `/faction join` command.
Choose wisely, since you can't change it later on.

## The Factions
### Humans
Humans gain the `Hero of the Village` and `Strength I` effect.
For easier trading, they get way more resources from farming Crops.
So their main goal is to trade with Villagers to get their items.
They also can ride horses faster, which is their best option for travelling long distances.

### Dwarfs
Dwarfs gain `Haste I` and `Resistence I` effects.
They gain more ores from mining and can also craft special pickaxes as shown below.
For travelling, they can use faster Minecarts, since they can walk a little slower.

Elbs are the only Faction which can use the Enchantment Table.
They walk and run faster and can jump higher.

### Oceanic
Lastly there is an Ocean faction, which has the Effects `Dolpins-Grace`, `Conduit-Power` and `Luck`.
So they can swim faster, breath underwater and get better Items from fishing.
They can also craft two Trident Versions.
The recipes are as follows:
